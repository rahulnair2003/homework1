What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge and git rebase are two approaches for managing workflow
across branches. Git rebase allows for a easier to follow commit history
structure because it stacks the commit history of one branch on top of 
the other. Git merge maintains the commit history of the two branches 
being worked on and connects them with a merge commit. While the commit
history structure is harder to visualize, maintaining the original structure
makes resolving conflicts a lot easier.
